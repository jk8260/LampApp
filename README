# Build Requirements
- Android Studio 2.1 (for building with Android Studio)
- Gradle 2.10
- Java SE Development Kit 7 update 80
- Android SDK API 23 (Google API's)
- Android SDK Build Tools 23.0.3

# Building QA Release
```
./gradlew clean :app:assembleQaRelease
```

# Building Production Release
```
./gradlew clean :app:assembleProductionRelease
```

# Signing APK

##QA
Keystore provided and signing configuration included in app/build.gradle

##Production
Signing configuration included in app/build.gradle.
The following need to be set in the build server as environment variables:

- Keystore password
- Key password
- Key alias
- Keystore download url

The name of the environment variables must match those in the app/build.gradle signingConfigs.productionRelease,
or they should be updated as required.

When :app:assembleProductionRelease is run, the keystore will be downloaded to the build folder so that it can
be used for signing the apk.

The keystore is deleted after the build completes.
