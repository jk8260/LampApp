           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            <p>Copy of the license follows.</p>

            <h2>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0</h2>

            <p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
                PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
                DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
                AGREEMENT.</p>

            <p><b>1. DEFINITIONS</b></p>

            <p>"Contribution" means:</p>

            <p class="list">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial
                code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
            <p class="list">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
            <p class="list">i) changes to the Program, and</p>
            <p class="list">ii) additions to the Program;</p>
            <p class="list">where such changes and/or additions to the Program
                originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
                Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
                Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
                Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
                Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
                conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)
                are not derivative works of the Program.</p>

            <p>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes
                the Program.</p>

            <p>"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a
                Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
                Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>

            <p>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance
                with this Agreement.</p>

            <p>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under
                this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>

            <p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b></p>

            <p class="list">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
                Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
                royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works
                of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
                Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in
                source code and object code form.</p>

            <p class="list">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
                Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
                royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,
                offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
                Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
                license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
                Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
                such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
                by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
                combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
                licensed hereunder.</p>

            <p class="list">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor
                grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances
                are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
                patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
                Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
                any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
                or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
                granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
                secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
                example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
                to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
                that license before distributing the Program.</p>

            <p class="list">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it
                has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
                the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>

            <p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>

            <p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
                form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>

            <p class="list">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
                Agreement; and</p>

            <p class="list">b) its license agreement:</p>

            <p class="list">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors
                all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
                or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
                conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>

            <p class="list">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors
                all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
                incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>

            <p class="list">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
                Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
                party; and</p>

            <p class="list">iv) states that source code for the Program is available
                from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
                reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
                exchange.</p>

            <p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>

            <p class="list">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>

            <p class="list">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each
                copy of the Program.</p>

            <p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
                within the Program.</p>

            <p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
                Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
                Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>

            <p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>

            <p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
                responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
                like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
                the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
                product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
                potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
                includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
                ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and
                indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
                against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses")
                arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
                party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
                acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
                distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
                obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
                relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
                order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
                the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
                Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
                Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
                Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
                expense.</p>

            <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
                product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
                Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
                claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
                claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
                alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
                defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
                performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
                Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
                must pay those damages.</p>

            <p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>

            <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
                PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
                OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
                OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
                responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
                distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
                exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
                the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
                damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
                interruption of operations.</p>

            <p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>

            <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
                NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
                INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
                WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
                LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
                NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
                DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
                HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

            <p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>

            <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
                applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
                the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
                by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
                extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

            <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
                (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
                Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
                software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
                Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
                date such litigation is filed.</p>

            <p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
                fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
                Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
                after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
                under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
                distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
                Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
                Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>

            <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
                Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
                copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
                Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including
                revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
                Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse
                Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
                assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
                suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
                given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
                Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
                Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
                of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
                Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
                expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
                rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
                this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
                otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
                Agreement are reserved.</p>

            <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
                the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
                to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
                than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its
                rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>
